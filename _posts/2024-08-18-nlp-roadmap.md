# Motivation

Welcome to the Natural Language Processing Roadmap <<>>

This roadmap is your hands-on, no-fluff guide to mastering NLP‚Äîfrom basic text processing to implementing actual working code. Over 9 structured weeks, you'll progressively unlock NLP's core concepts through carefully designed content, practical mini assignments, and real-world projects. While challenging, everything here is absolutely achievable with consistent effort and curiosity.

**Flexible Structure (Highly Recommended but Not Rigid)**

We've arranged topics in a logical progression, especially for the first few weeks where NLP techniques form the critical foundation. 

Timing is flexible too. Some days, you‚Äôll binge a week‚Äôs content in one sitting; other times, a single concept might take days to click. Both are normal! The key is to keep moving forward without burning out. Enjoy the journey‚ÄîNLP is as much art as it is science . 

# Background

Machine Learning primarily deals with structured datasets‚Äînumbers, tables, and well-organized records that can be fed into algorithms.

But what if we want to analyze something more complex? For example, suppose we want to assess a company‚Äôs market status by understanding its recent news articles, press releases, or social media updates. These are written in natural language, which is messy, ambiguous, and heavily dependent on context.

This raises the question: How can machines make sense of language‚Äîthe way humans naturally communicate?

The answer lies in Natural Language Processing (NLP), a subfield of AI that enables machines to process, understand, and generate human language. Through NLP techniques such as text preprocessing, embeddings, sentiment analysis, and language models, we can extract insights from unstructured text data, allowing applications like:

- Market sentiment analysis
- News classification
- Trend detection
- Automated summarization of financial reports

Thus, NLP bridges the gap between raw human language and structured machine understanding, enabling Machine Learning to be applied meaningfully to text-based problems.

# Meta-Summary

This roadmap begins with the foundations of text preprocessing and representation, where we learn to clean, normalize, and encode text using techniques like Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, one-hot encoding, and word embeddings, eventually leveraging pretrained embeddings for tasks such as sentiment classification. From there, we move into sequence models, starting with RNNs and LSTMs, implementing them from scratch, and then extending to GRUs and statistical language modeling with n-grams, Seq2Seq, and beam search decoding. 

Building on this, we introduce attention mechanisms‚Äîself-attention, multi-head attention, and scaled dot-product attention‚Äîleading to the implementation of a basic Transformer and a deeper exploration of encoder-decoder, encoder-only, and decoder-only architectures. With this foundation, the roadmap transitions into Large Language Models (LLMs), covering their design, visualization, transfer learning, fine-tuning, evaluation, and multilingual applications, followed by advanced reinforcement learning techniques for LLMs such as RLHF, DPO, and multi-agent reinforcement learning. 

Finally, we expand into speech and multimodal NLP, where we explore text-to-speech pipelines, neural vocoders, automatic speech recognition (ASR) with models like Whisper and wav2vec, and emerging cross-modal NLP trends, concluding with hands-on projects in TTS, ASR, and multimodal applications.

Remember , small efforts everyday culminate in making a huge impact. Hence don't feel too overwhelmed by the length of this roadmap . Go day by day and step by step, and you'll find your knowledge growing immensely.

## üëæ<span id="week1day1">Day 1: Overview</span>
First of all, check out this amazing playlist by TensorFlow to get a crisp idea of what we are going to do this week. It‚Äôs packed with insightful videos that will lay a solid foundation for your NLP journey!

[YouTube Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQY2H8rRoyvzDbLUZkbudP-MFQZwNmU4S)

<a id="week1day2"></a>
## üëæ Day 2: Kickstarting with Text Preprocessing, Normalization, Regular Expressions, and Edit Distance

Concisely speaking , the topics above play the role of Data Sanitization, and are hence extremely important to study NLP. Lets dive deeper below :

#### a. Text Preprocessing: The Foundation of NLP
Imagine trying to read a messy, smudged book ‚Äì not fun, right? Text preprocessing is like cleaning up that book, making it crisp and readable. It transforms chaotic, noisy text into a tidy format that‚Äôs ready for analysis. This process is crucial because cleaner data leads to better NLP model performance!

 Explore More:
Dive deeper into text preprocessing [here](https://ayselaydin.medium.com/1-text-preprocessing-techniques-for-nlp-37544483c007).

#### b. Text Normalization: Streamlining Your Data
Think of text normalization as decluttering your digital workspace. It standardizes text, eliminating noise and focusing on the essence. This involves steps like converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation, and applying techniques like lemmatization and stemming. Essentially, it‚Äôs text preprocessing on steroids!

 Discover the Magic of Normalization:
Learn more about normalization [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/text-normalization-7ecc8e084e31/)

#### c. Regular Expressions: Your Pattern Detective
Regular expressions (regex) are like the ultimate search-and-replace tool, but on steroids! They help you find patterns in text ‚Äì imagine being able to pinpoint every email address or phone number in a document with a simple command.

Check out this blog on regex [here](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/03/beginners-guide-to-regular-expressions-in-natural-language-processing/)

#### d. Edit Distance: Measuring Textual Similarity
Ever wondered how similar two strings are? Edit distance, specifically Levenshtein distance, tells you the minimum number of edits (insertions, deletions, substitutions) needed to transform one string into another. It‚Äôs like calculating the steps to turn ‚Äúkitten‚Äù into ‚Äúsitting.‚Äù

 Get Detailed Insight:
Learn more about edit distance [here](https://medium.com/@_ektagarg/what-is-edit-distance-levenshtein-distance-e4373d8adb3c)


<a id="week1day3"></a>
## üëæ Day 3: Diving into Text Representation Techniques(BoW,TF-IDF,CBoW)
a. **Bag of Words (BoW)**: The Basic Building Block
Imagine reducing a sentence to a simple bag of words, ignoring grammar and order. BoW does just that, focusing on the presence of words. It‚Äôs a straightforward way to tokenize text but doesn‚Äôt capture context.

Understand BoW:
Explore the concept of Bag of Words [here](https://ayselaydin.medium.com/4-bag-of-words-model-in-nlp-434cb38cdd1b)

b. **TF-IDF**: Adding Depth to Word Representation
TF-IDF adds a twist to BoW by weighing terms based on their importance. It highlights significant words while downplaying common ones. TF (Term Frequency) measures how often a word appears in a document, while IDF (Inverse Document Frequency) gauges the word‚Äôs rarity across documents.

Formula Breakdown:

###  Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) Formulas

**Term Frequency (TF):**

$$
TF(t, d) = \frac{\text{Number of times term } t \text{ appears in document } d}{\text{Total number of terms in document } d}
$$

---

**Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):**

$$
IDF(t, D) = \log \left( \frac{\text{Total number of documents}}{\text{Number of documents containing the term } t} \right)
$$

---

**TF-IDF Score:**

$$
TF\text{-}IDF(t, d, D) = TF(t, d) \times IDF(t, D)
$$

#### c. Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW): Contextual Word Embeddings
CBOW is part of the Word2Vec family, predicting a target word based on its context. It‚Äôs like filling in the blanks in a sentence using surrounding words, capturing semantic relationships.

How It Works: For the sentence ‚ÄúThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog‚Äù and the target word ‚Äúfox,‚Äù CBOW uses the context (‚ÄúThe,‚Äù ‚Äúquick,‚Äù ‚Äújumps,‚Äù ‚Äúover‚Äù) to predict ‚Äúfox.‚Äù

Discover CBOW:

<a id="week1day4"></a>
## üëæ Day 4: Diving into One-Hot Encoding and Word Embeddings
#### a. One-Hot Encoding: The Basic Building Block of NLP
Imagine trying to categorize a group of objects where each object belongs to a unique category. One-hot encoding is like assigning a unique ID card to each word in your text, where each card contains just one slot marked ‚Äú1‚Äù and all other slots marked ‚Äú0.‚Äù This approach transforms words into a format that machines can understand and process.

##### How It Works: 
Each word is represented as a vector with a length equal to the total number of unique words (vocabulary size). In this vector, only one element is ‚Äúhot‚Äù (set to 1), and the rest are ‚Äúcold‚Äù (set to 0).
Example: For a vocabulary of [‚Äòapple‚Äô, ‚Äòbanana‚Äô, ‚Äòcherry‚Äô]:
‚Äòapple‚Äô ‚Üí [1, 0, 0]
‚Äòbanana‚Äô ‚Üí [0, 1, 0]
‚Äòcherry‚Äô ‚Üí [0, 0, 1]
Explore More: Learn more about one-hot encoding [here.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/ml-one-hot-encoding/)

#### b. Word Embeddings: Adding Depth to Word Representations
You shall know a word by the company it keeps ‚Äî J.R. Firth
While one-hot encoding is simple, it doesn‚Äôt capture the relationships or meanings of words. Enter word embeddings ‚Äì a more sophisticated approach where words are represented as dense vectors in a continuous vector space. These vectors are learned from the text data itself, capturing semantic relationships and similarities between words.

##### How It Works: 
Word embeddings are created using algorithms like Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText. Each word is mapped to a vector of fixed size (e.g., 100 dimensions) where similar words have similar vectors.
Example: For the words ‚Äòking‚Äô, ‚Äòqueen‚Äô, ‚Äòman‚Äô, and ‚Äòwoman‚Äô, word embeddings might capture the relationships like:
‚Äòking‚Äô - ‚Äòman‚Äô + ‚Äòwoman‚Äô ‚âà ‚Äòqueen‚Äô
‚Äòman‚Äô and ‚Äòwoman‚Äô will be closer to each other in the vector space than ‚Äòman‚Äô and ‚Äòbanana‚Äô.

<a id="week1day5"></a>
## üëæ Day 5: Unlocking the Power of Pretrained Embeddings
#### a. Pretrained Embeddings: Supercharging NLP with Pre-trained Knowledge
Think of pretrained embeddings as getting a head start in a race. Instead of starting from scratch, you leverage the knowledge already learned from massive text corpora. This can significantly boost your NLP models‚Äô performance by providing rich, contextual word representations right out of the box.

##### How It Works:
Pretrained embeddings, such as those from Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText, are trained on large datasets like Wikipedia or Common Crawl. These embeddings capture nuanced word meanings and relationships, offering a robust foundation for various NLP tasks.
Benefits:
**Efficiency**: Saves time and computational resources since the heavy lifting of training embeddings has already been done.
**Performance**: Often leads to better model performance due to the high-quality, contextual word representations.
**Transfer Learning**: Facilitates transfer learning, where knowledge from one task (like language modeling) can be applied to another (like sentiment analysis).
#### b. Popular Pretrained Embeddings and How to Use Them
### [Word2Vec](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqRCEmrv1gQ&t=5s)
- For a really good explantion you can watch the [working of word2vec](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rXD5-xhemo)
- Description: Word2Vec models come in two flavors ‚Äì Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) and Skip-gram. Both capture word relationships effectively.
- How to Use: Available via libraries like Gensim. Simply load the pretrained model and start using the embeddings in your projects.
- The original Word2Vec project by google can be found [here](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/)
### [GloVe](https://towardsdatascience.com/glove-research-paper-explained-4f5b78b68f89/)(Global Vectors for Word Representation)
- **Description**: GloVe embeddings are generated by aggregating global word-word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus. It can help in dealing with languages for which the word2vec and glove fail as they are trained mainly for english.
- **How to Use**: Pretrained GloVe vectors can be downloaded and integrated into your models using libraries like Gensim or directly via NumPy.
- The original stanford project of glove can be found [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)
### [FastText](https://fasttext.cc/)
**Description**: Unlike Word2Vec and GloVe, FastText considers subword information, making it effective for morphologically rich languages and rare words.

**How to Use**: Available via the FastText library. Load pretrained vectors and incorporate them into your models with ease.

<a id="week1day6"></a>
## üëæ Day 6: Understanding Sentiment Classification
This is the first real world use case of NLP that we are going to discuss from scratch.

#### a. Sentiment Classification: Uncovering Emotions in Text
Imagine trying to understand someone‚Äôs mood just by reading their messages. Sentiment classification does exactly that ‚Äì it helps in identifying the emotional tone behind a body of text, whether it‚Äôs positive, negative, or neutral. This technique is widely used in applications like customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and more. By Definition, Sentiment analysis is a process that involves analyzing textual data such as social media posts, product reviews, customer feedback, news articles, or any other form of text to classify the sentiment expressed in the text.

**How It Works:** Sentiment classification models analyze text and predict the sentiment based on the words and phrases used.The sentiment can be classified into three categories: Positive Sentiment Expressions indicate a favorable opinion or satisfaction; Negative Sentiment Expressions indicate dissatisfaction, criticism, or negative views; and Neutral Sentiment Text expresses no particular sentiment or is unclear. These models can be built using various algorithms, from simple rule-based approaches to complex machine learning techniques.

Example: For the sentence ‚ÄúI love this product!‚Äù:
The model would classify it as positive.
For ‚ÄúI hate waiting for customer service,‚Äù it would classify it as negative.
üé• Watch and Learn:
Learn more about sentiment classification [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HQCNAsSO-s&ab_channel=IBMTechnology)

#### b. Techniques for Sentiment Classification
**Rule-Based Methods**

Description: These methods use a set of manually created rules to determine sentiment. For example, lists of positive and negative words can be used to score the sentiment of a text.
Pros: Simple and interpretable.
Cons: Limited by the quality and comprehensiveness of the rules.
**Machine Learning Methods**

Description: These methods use labeled data to train classifiers like Naive Bayes, SVM, or logistic regression. The models learn from the data and can generalize to new, unseen texts.
Pros: More flexible and accurate than rule-based methods.
Cons: Require labeled data for training and can be computationally intensive.
**Deep Learning Methods**

Description: These methods leverage neural networks, such as RNNs, LSTMs, or transformers, to capture complex patterns in the text. Pretrained models like BERT and GPT can also be fine-tuned for sentiment analysis.
Pros: State-of-the-art performance, capable of capturing nuanced sentiments.
Cons: Require significant computational resources and large amounts of data.

## Prelimnary knowledge:
A neural network is a type of artificial intelligence model that maps the structure and function of the human brain to learn from data and make decisions or predictions. It consists of interconnected layers of nodes, or "neurons," which process information and adjust "weights"(or simply parameters) on their connections to identify patterns and solve complex problems, making them useful for tasks like image recognition, language translation, and predictive analytics.

The core idea here is that language is sequential. It is not a bag of words ‚Äî its meaning depends on order and context. RNNs/LSTMs are designed to consume a sequence and maintain a hidden state (memory) that summarizes what has come before.

Sequence Models,RNNs and LSTMs are models that **process data in a specific order** (like sentences or speech). They help machines understand the meaning and context of language by processing words and sentences as sequences, not isolated tokens.

As the name suggests, RNNs are a type of nueral networks that are recurrent in nature . Recurrent here essentially implies that these nueral networks have nodes that linked in a loop. This essentially means that at step pf processing , a node in RNN takes an input and gives an output and this output is provided alongside the input of the next step. This allows the RNN to remember previous steps in a sequence . But RNNs suffer from *long term dependency problem* which is called so to imply that with time as more information piles up , the RNN fails to learn new things effectively . 

Here's when LSMT comes in to save the day . LSTMs provide a solution to the long term dependency problem by adding an *internal state* to the RNN node. Now this state information is also used while processing in the node.

```
Here's the link to the research paper of the model : [Research Paper of RNNs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.05911)


By learning RNN, your journey of NLP with deep learning truly starts here. RNNs by themselves are of little use, but they form the building blocks of many bigger models.

As stated above, a **recurrent neural network (RNN)** is a type of **artificial neural network** which uses sequential data or time series data. These deep learning algorithms are commonly used for ordinal or temporal problems, such as language translation, natural language processing (nlp), speech recognition, and image captioning; they are incorporated into popular applications such as Siri, voice search, and Google Translate.

For understanding RNNs and their implementation in tensorflow, go through the following links:

- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-recurrent-neural-network/
- https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2022/03/a-brief-overview-of-recurrent-neural-networks-rnn/

This RNN cheatsheet by Stanford shall come in handy for revision .

While talking about RNNs and LSTMs , context refers memory of past inputs that helps in interpreting the current input correctly.

<a id="week2day3"></a>
## üëæ Day 3: Implementing RNN from scratch
To truly understand RNNs, you must understand how to implement them from scratch. Use your knowledge to implement them in python, and use the following link as a reference if you get stuck: https://towardsdatascience.com/recurrent-neural-networks-rnns-3f06d7653a85

You can also refer to the following notebooks:

- RNN Implementation using Keras
- RNN from scratch Kaggle notebook

<a id="week2day4"></a>
## üëæ Day 4 and 5: Understanding LSTMs

[Research paper for LSMTs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.09586)


RNNs show multiple issues like Vanishing and Exploding gradient descent. To understand these issues better, follow the link: 
https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/07/lets-understand-the-problems-with-recurrent-neural-networks/

These issues are largely solved by Long Short Term Memory Models, which efficiently maintain short term as well as long term context, along with having an added functionality to eliminate information or memory if it‚Äôs no longer required.

This article is recommended as it provides an in-depth understanding of usually hard-to-understand LSTMs.

You can refer to this article as well for better visualizations.

<a id="week2day6"></a>
## üëæ Day 6: Implementing an LSTM from scratch
Use the knowledge gained to implement an LSTM from scratch. You can refer to the following articles if you face issues in implementing it: https://medium.com/@CallMeTwitch/building-a-neural-network-zoo-from-scratch-the-long-short-term-memory-network-1cec5cf31b7

## üëæ Day 7: RNN and LSTM Variations

There exist various variants and optimized versions of LSTMs and RNNs to better handle sequential data, long-term dependencies, and complex patterns.

## LSTM Variations

### [Bidirectional LSTM](https://medium.com/@anishnama20/understanding-bidirectional-lstm-for-sequential-data-processing-b83d6283befc)

Think of reading a sentence : sometimes, the meaning of a word depends on what came before it and what comes after it. This variation processes sequences in both forward and backward directions, allowing the model to capture context from past and future tokens simultaneously.

### [LSTM Seq2seq](https://pradeep-dhote9.medium.com/seq2seq-encoder-decoder-lstm-model-1a1c9a43bbac)

Uses an [encoder-decoder ](#week5day1) for mapping input sequences to output sequences, commonly used in translation and summarization tasks.

### [LSTM Bidirectional Seq2Seq](https://medium.com/@anishnama20/understanding-bidirectional-lstm-for-sequential-data-processing-b83d6283befc)
Combines bidirectional LSTMs in the encoder with a decoder, improving context understanding in sequence-to-sequence tasks.

## RNN Variations

### [Bi-RNNs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atYPhweJ7ao&ab_channel=codebasics)

RNNs that read sequences forward and backward, enhancing performance in tasks where both past and future context matter.

### [Deep RNNs](https://d2l.ai/chapter_recurrent-modern/deep-rnn.html)

Stack multiple RNN layers to learn more complex representations, allowing the model to capture hierarchical patterns in sequential data.

## üëæ Day 3: Statistical Language Modeling
In NLP, a language model is a probability distribution over strings on an alphabet.

Seq2Seq model or Sequence-to-Sequence model, is a machine learning architecture designed for tasks involving sequential data. It takes an input sequence, processes it, and generates an output sequence. The architecture consists of two fundamental components: an encoder and a decoder. This Encoder-Decoder Architecture is also used in Transformers which we shall study later. Go through these resources for understading Seq2Seq better:

## üëæ Day 7: Beam Search Decoding
Beam search is an algorithm used in many NLP and speech recognition models as a final decision making layer to choose the best output given target variables like maximum probability or next output character. It is an alternative to Greedy Search which is largely used outside NLP, but although Beam Search requries high compute, it is much more efficient than Greedy Search. THis approach is largely used in the decoder part of the sequence model. For better understadning, go through the following:

Attention mechanisms help models focus on relevant parts of input data.

Here's the link for the paper which introduced the transformer model [Attention is all you need](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf)

<a id="week4day1"></a>
## üëæ Day 1: Why we need attention and how does it work?

### The need for attention-mechanisms in NLP
An attention mechanism is a machine learning technique that directs deep learning models to prioritize (or attend to) the most relevant parts of input data. Innovation in attention mechanisms enabled the transformer architecture that yielded the modern large language models (LLMs) that power popular applications like ChatGPT. This mechanism allows the models to weigh the importance of different parts of an input sequence to understand their relationships and context.
 
As their name suggests, attention mechanisms are inspired by the ability of humans (and other animals) to selectively pay more attention to salient details and ignore details that are less important in the moment. Having access to all information but focusing on only the most relevant information helps to ensure that no meaningful details are lost while enabling efficient use of limited memory and time.

Mathematically speaking, an attention mechanism computes attention weights that reflect the relative importance of each part of an input sequence to the task at hand. It then applies those attention weights to increase (or decrease) the influence of each part of the input, in accordance with its respective importance. An attention model‚Äîthat is, an artificial intelligence model that employs an attention mechanism‚Äîis trained to assign accurate attention weights through supervised learning or self-supervised learning on a large dataset of examples.

### How NLP worked before attention

RNNs quickly suffer from vanishing or exploding gradients in training. This made RNNs impractical for many NLP tasks, as it greatly limited the length of input sentences they could process. These limitations were somewhat mitigated by an improved RNN architecture called long short term memory networks (LSTMs), which add gating mechanisms to preserve ‚Äúlong term‚Äù memory.

Before attention was introduced, the Seq2Seq model was the state-of-the-art model for machine translation. Seq2Seq uses two LSTMs in an encoder-decoder architecture.

The first LSTM, the encoder, processes the source sentence step by step, then outputs the hidden state of the final timestep. This output, the context vector, encodes the whole sentence as one vector embedding. To enable Seq2Seq to flexibly handle sentences with varying numbers of word, the context vector is always the same length.
The second LSTM, the decoder, takes the vector embedding output by the encoder as its initial input and decodes it, word by word, into a second language.

Encoding input sequences in a fixed number of dimensions allowed Seq2Seq to process sequences of varying length, but also introduced important flaws:

- It represents long or complex sequences with the same level of detail as shorter, simpler sentences. This causes an information bottleneck for longer sequences and wastes resources for shorter sequences.
- This vector represents only the final hidden state of the encoder network. In theory, each subsequent hidden state should contain information provided by the previous hidden state, which in turn contains information from the prior time step, and so on, back to the first step. In practice, the context vector inevitably ‚Äúforgets‚Äù information from early time steps, hindering model performance on lengthier sequences.
 


Example:
"The cat, which had been hiding under the bed for hours, finally came out."

An RNN might forget "cat" by the time it reaches "came out".

### How Attention Solves These Problems
Instead of passing along only the final hidden state of the encoder‚Äîthe context vector‚Äîto the decoder, their model passed every encoder hidden state to the decoder. The attention mechanism itself was used to determine which hidden state‚Äîthat is, which word in the original sentence‚Äîwas most relevant at each translation step performed by the decoder.

In a nutshell,the attention model :

- Focuses on relevant words dynamically (no fixed window size).
- Processes all words in parallel (unlike RNNs).
- Remembers long-range dependencies (no information decay).

## TYPES OF ATTENTION MECHANISMS


<a id="week4day2"></a>
## üëæ Day 2: Self-Attention: 
![Transformers](https://dezyre.gumlet.io/images/blog/transformers-architecture/Self-Attention_Mechanism_in_Transformer_Model_Architecture.png?w=1242&dpr=1.3)
Self-attention is the core mechanism that allows transformers to process sequential data (like text) by dynamically weighing the importance of different parts of the input. 

Self-attention lets each position (e.g., each word in a sentence) look at all other positions and decide which ones to focus on. Unlike RNNs/CNNs, it: processes all positions in parallel (no sequential dependency).
Captures long-range dependencies directly (no information decay over distance).

### Suggested Resources:
1.[This is a great article](https://medium.com/@geetkal67/attention-networks-a-simple-way-to-understand-self-attention-f5fb363c736d) introducing essential topics in self attention like, positional encoding, query, value ,key ,etc without going deep into the maths.

2.[Watch this to get intution of how self attention work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGTUuEx3GkA)

3.[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIvKXrEDMhk) will help you understand why we need keys, values and query matrices

4.See the coding part in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCJQG4DuHT0&t=452s) to get idea of the working of self attention

<a id="week4day3"></a>
## üëæ Day 3: Multi-Head Attention: 
Multi-head attention is a powerful extension of self-attention that allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. Here's a comprehensive breakdown:


Instead of performing a single attention function, multi-head attention runs multiple parallel attention heads** (typically 8-16).Each head learns different attention patterns (e.g., syntactic, semantic, positional relationships).
Combines results from all heads to form the final output.

Why it works:
Different heads can specialize in different types of relationships (e.g., one head for subject-verb agreement, another for pronoun resolution).

[Read this article to get more details](https://towardsdatascience.com/transformers-explained-visually-part-3-multi-head-attention-deep-dive-1c1ff1024853/)

<a id="week4day4"></a>
## üëæ Day 4 : Attention calculation using Scaled dot product 
Attention mechanisms have to compute how much focus to place on different parts of the input. It works by:

Comparing a Query (Q) with all Keys (K) using dot products.
Scaling the scores by ‚àö(dimension of keys) to prevent gradient vanishing.
Applying softmax** to get attention weights (0 to 1).
Using these weights to compute a weighted sum of Values (V).

The attention function is defined as:

$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
$$

Where:
- $Q$: Query matrix (dimension $d_k$)**
- $K$: Key matrix (dimension $d_k$)**
- $V$: Value matrix (dimension $d_v$)**
- $d_k$: Dimension of keys (scaling factor)
- $softmax$: Applied row-wise to normalize attention weights

<a id="week4day5"></a>
## üëæ Day 5:Transformer Network


### Introduction:
The Transformer network is a architecture that relies entirely on self-attention mechanisms to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution.
It is the backbone of many modern LLMs like chatGPT(where GPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer),Gemini,Llama, BERT which have been built upon the transformer network

# ü¶ù Week 5: Deep dive into Transformer Models and Intro to LLMs



This week will give you an in-depth dive into the various types of transformers and later we'll begin with LLMs

<a id="week5day1"></a>
## üëæDay 1: What do Transformers do?
Transformers are the current state-of-the-art type of model for dealing with sequences. Perhaps the most prominent application of these models is in text processing tasks, and the most prominent of these is machine translation. In fact, transformers and their conceptual progeny have infiltrated just about every benchmark leaderboard in natural language processing (NLP), from question answering to grammar correction.


```mermaid

    end

```

Here the transformer is represented as a black box. An entire sequence of (x‚Äôs in the diagram) is parsed simultaneously in feed-forward manner, producing a transformed output tensor. In this diagram the output sequence is more concise than the input sequence. For practical NLP tasks, word order and sentence length may vary substantially.

Here's a deep dive into the architecture of transformers  https://www.exxactcorp.com/blog/Deep-Learning/a-deep-dive-into-the-transformer-architecture-the-development-of-transformer-models

Transformers revolutionized sequence-to-sequence tasks like language translation by using the multi-head attention mechanism instead of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). It processes data in parallel, allowing for more efficient training and handling of long-range dependencies in sequences, overcoming limitations of RNNs.


<a id="week5day2"></a>
## üëæ Day 2: Encoder-Decoder Models
The encoder-decoder model is a type of neural network that is mainly used for tasks where both the input and output are sequences. This architecture is used when the input and output sequences are not the same length for example translating a sentence from one language to another, summarizing a paragraph, describing an image with a caption or convert speech into text.

It works in two stages:

- Encoder: The encoder takes the input data like a sentence and processes each word one by one then creates a single, fixed-size summary of the entire input called a context vector or latent space.
- Decoder: The decoder takes the context vector and begins to produce the output one step at a time.

#### For example, in machine translation an encoder-decoder model might take an English sentence as input (like "I am learning AI") and translate it into French ("Je suis en train d'apprendre l'IA").

### Encoder-Decoder Model Architecture
In an encoder-decoder model both the encoder and decoder are separate networks each one has its own specific task. These networks can be different types such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) or even more advanced models like Transformers as mentioned above.

<a id="week5day3"></a>
## üëæ Day 3: Encoder-only and Decoder-only Models

### Encoder-only Models
Encoder-only models use just the encoder part of the Transformer architecture. They are designed to understand the input, but they don‚Äôt generate new text. They are great for tasks that need the model to make sense of a sentence or document, like text classification or extracting information.

#### Use Cases
- Text Classification
- Named Entity Recognition
- Extractive Question Answering

### Decoder-only Models

These models only use the decoder part of the Transformer architecture. They are used for generating text or predicting the next word in a sequence. These models are great for tasks like writing stories or auto-completing sentences.

#### Use Cases
- Text Generation
- Language Modeling

You can refer to this amazing article talking about encoders and decoders in detail:
https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/understanding-encoder-and-decoder

<a id="week5day4"></a>
## üëæ Day 4: Comparing Architectures
Encoder-only models are commonly used to learn embeddings for classification and understanding tasks.
Encoder-decoder models are well-suited for generative tasks where the output strongly depends on the input, such as translation or summarization.
Decoder-only models are typically applied to open-ended generative tasks, including question answering and text generation.

<a id="week5day5"></a>
## üëæ Day 5: Optimization for Transformers

Before we get into optimizations, let‚Äôs talk about why traditional Transformers can feel like that one friend who always picks the priciest item on the menu. The problem lies in attention: every word in a sentence has to ‚Äúpay attention‚Äù to every other word to understand context. Sounds fine at first, but for a 1,000-word document that‚Äôs 1,000 √ó 1,000 = 1,000,000 comparisons. Stretch that to 10,000 words, and suddenly you‚Äôre looking at 100 million comparisons. Things spiral out of control quickly.

This quadratic growth means both memory use and computation time blow up as documents get longer. It‚Äôs like trying to have a group chat where everyone insists on talking to everyone else before saying anything ‚Äî manageable in a small group, total chaos in a stadium.

That‚Äôs where State Space Models (SSMs) come in.

SSMs are a family of models designed to predict how systems evolve over time, traditionally used in control systems engineering. They model sequences with differential equations and have recently been adapted for machine learning tasks.Underpinning SSMs are two simple equations: one describes the internal dynamics of a system that aren‚Äôt directly observable, and the other describes how those internal dynamics relate to observable results. That simple, flexible formulation is extremely adaptable for a wide variety of multivariate time series data.

![SSMs](https://wallstreetmojocms.recurpro.in/uploads/State_Space_Model_8eb3df5acf.jpg)


*Mamba*, a neural network built on a selective variant of structured SSMs, has shown performance on par with Transformers in language modeling.

### Why Mamba stands out:

- Linear scaling: Memory and compute grow in proportion to sequence length, not squared.
- Constant memory: Whether it‚Äôs 100 words or 100,000, memory use stays flat.
- 5√ó faster throughput: Achieves much higher speeds for similar-sized models.
- Million-token capacity: Can process extremely long sequences that would overwhelm a Transformer.

<a id="week6day2"></a>
## üëæ Day 2: Transfer Learning in NLP
Transfer learning is a technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) where a pre-trained model (already trained on a large dataset) is reused and fine-tuned for a new, specific task instead of training from scratch.

### How Does It Work?
#### Pre-trained Model:

A model (like BERT, GPT, or T5) is first trained on a huge general dataset (e.g., Wikipedia, books, news articles).

It learns general language patterns like grammar, word meanings, and sentence structure.

#### Fine-tuning for a New Task:

Instead of training a new model from zero, we take the pre-trained model and adjust (fine-tune) it slightly for a specific task (e.g., spam detection, sentiment analysis, chatbots).

This requires much less data and computing power than training from scratch.

### List of Transfer Learning Models in NLP:

-  **BERT**: BERT is pre-trained for two major tasks -- predicting missing(masked) words in a sentence, and next sentence prediction. When fine-tuned, we keep BERT's learned language knowledge as it is, and just add the new specific task layer. This way, it adapts quickly to new NLP tasks with less data.
- **RoBERTa**: It is an improved version of BERT, as it removes next sentence prediction and focusses on optimizing masked language modelling by training on more data. It ultimately works just like BERT, that is the pre-trained knowledge is transferred, and a small task-specific layer is added.

<a id="week6day3"></a>
## üëæ Day 3: Foundations of Training and Fine-Tuning LLMs
Novice‚Äôs LLM Training Guide: https://rentry.org/llm-training provides a comprehensive introduction to LLM Training covering concepts to consider while fine-tuning of LLMs. This is a good starting point to understand what happens ‚Äúunder the hood‚Äù during training.

**One of the most important component of fine-tuning of LLMs is using quality datasets.** This directly affects the quality of the model in the following ways:
- High-quality, well-structured data ‚Üí better generalization and fewer hallucinations.
- Poor-quality or noisy data ‚Üí model picks up errors, biases, or irrelevant patterns.

## üëæ Day 4: Prompting, Fine-Tuning Tools, and Efficient Training

Prompts act like instructions for the model.

## üëæ Day 5: Advanced Fine-Tuning Techniques
We'll discuss two of the PEFT(Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) techniques, where the goal is to fine-tune only a fraction of model parameters instead of the entire model.
- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation):**
LoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters by training only a few low-ranked matrices instead of updating all model parameters. This makes fine-tuning efficient, and reduces compute cost. To put in numbers, training a multi-billion parameter model may only require training a few million when using LoRA.
Go through this [IBM article](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/lora) to learn more about LoRA.
Use the following article to implement LoRA:
-- [Implementing LoRA](https://medium.com/data-science/implementing-lora-from-scratch-20f838b046f1)

- **QLoRA (Quantized LoRA):**
QLoRA builds on LoRA by combining quantization (reducing precision of weights) with low-rank adaptation. Here, models are stored in lower precision (like 4-bit), and only small LoRA adapters are fine-tuned, making it possible to train large models on a single GPU.
Read [this article](https://medium.com/@sulbha.jindal/qlora-efficient-finetuning-of-quantized-llms-paper-re-0984016c9bc9) to learn more about QLoRA.

## üëæ Day 6: Evaluating LLMs

Evaluating LLMs is just as important as building them. But this is where the challenge lies -- unlike traditional ML Models with clear accuracy metrics, language generation needs specialized evaluation methods to judge fluency and usefulness. Here are a few such methods:

**BLEU**: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) compares a machine-generated text to one or more human-generated reference texts and assigns a score based on how similar the machine-generated text is to the reference texts. More on BLEU metric and its flaws: https://towardsdatascience.com/evaluating-text-output-in-nlp-bleu-at-your-own-risk-e8609665a213

**Perplexity**: BLEU evaluates text generation quality against human references, while with Perplexity, we try to evaluate the similarity between the token (probably sentences) distribution generated by the model and the one in the test data. More on Perplexity: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/perplexity

**ROUGE**: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is another set of metrics used for automatic summarization and machine translation. Unlike BLEU, which focuses on precision, ROUGE is all about recall. It measures the number of n-grams (or word sequences) in the machine-generated summary that also appear in the human-generated reference summaries.

- ROUGE-N: Compares n-grams. For example, ROUGE-1 looks at unigrams (single words), while ROUGE-2 looks at bigrams (pairs of words).
- ROUGE-L: Focuses on the longest common subsequence (LCS) between the machine summary and the reference, which accounts for sentence-level structure.

Survey on Evaluation of LLMs: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03109 is a very comprehensive research paper on evaluation of LLMs and definitely a recommended read!

## üëæ Day 7: Multilingual NLP ‚Äì Breaking Language Barriers


Multilingual NLP aims to make AI systems accessible across languages, not just English. The challenge is that the world has **7,000+ languages**, many of which are low-resource (little training data). Problems include building translation systems, answering questions across languages, and handling code-switching (when people mix languages in one sentence). 

Instead of training a separate model per language, modern approaches use **shared multilingual models** trained on huge multilingual corpora, allowing **transfer learning** from high-resource (like English) to low-resource languages. 


#### Key Tasks:
- Machine Translation (MT)
- Cross-lingual Question Answering (QA)
- Cross-lingual Information Retrieval
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) across languages
- Multilingual Sentiment Analysis and Summarization
- Code-Switching Handling (mix of languages within sentences)

#### Popular Models:
- `mBERT`, `XLM`, `XLM-R`, `mT5`, `NLLB`, `SeamlessM4T`, `BLOOM`


Now we will specifically see what models are used for which tasks:

## üëæ Day 1: RLHF & RLAIF <a id='week6day1'></a>

**Brief Intro:**  
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) uses human comparisons to train a reward model that scores candidate text continuations, then applies Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to guide an LLM toward safer, more helpful outputs. Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) swaps expensive human labels for critiques generated by a stronger model or a rules-based system, enabling faster, cheaper scaling of reward signals.

**Key Concepts:**  
- **Reward-Model Training:** Learn to predict which of two outputs a human prefers by minimizing the difference in reward scores.  
- **PPO Fine-Tuning:** Limit policy updates by clipping the ratio between new and old action probabilities to stabilize learning.  
- **Synthetic Feedback (RLAIF):** Use AI-generated labels to simulate human judgments, reducing annotation cost by up to 60%.

**Where It‚Äôs Used:**  
- Production chatbots (ChatGPT, Bard) to reduce unsafe or off-topic responses  
- Enterprise LLM services (AWS Bedrock, Anthropic Claude) for large-scale alignment

<a id="week7day2"></a>
## üëæ Day 2: GRPO & Efficient RL Fine‚ÄëTuning<a id='week6day2'></a>
**Brief Intro:**  
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) provides token-level rewards, giving precise control over specific generation behaviors (e.g., math correctness or policy compliance). Efficient RL Fine‚ÄëTuning techniques‚Äîsuch as async rollout architectures and difficulty‚Äëtargeted sampling‚Äîdramatically reduce compute by focusing on the most informative experiences and keeping GPUs busy.

**Key Concepts:**  
- **Token-Level Rewards (GRPO):** Assign a reward to each generated token rather than to full sequences, allowing fine-grained optimization.  
- **Async Rollouts:** Parallel actor processes collect new data simultaneously, feeding it into a shared learner to avoid idle compute resources.  
- **Difficulty-Targeted Sampling:** Measure the ‚Äúhardness‚Äù of trajectories (e.g., via prediction error) and sample more frequently from those, accelerating learning.

**Where It‚Äôs Used:**  
- Advanced reasoning modules in research LLMs (proof generation, code synthesis)  
- Domain-specific assistants requiring tight control over output behavior

## üëæ Day 3: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Reward Densification<a id='week6day3'></a>

**Brief Intro:**
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and reward densification explore new approaches for aligning language models more efficiently by using richer feedback and bypassing conventional reward modeling steps. DPO directly optimizes model policy in response to comparison data, often outperforming traditional RLHF in handling ambiguous or multi-objective tasks. Reward densification leverages token-level or intermediate feedback (including from language model critics) to resolve sparse reward issues.

**Key Concepts:**
* **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO):** Directly optimizes the policy against pairwise preference data, avoiding the need for reward model approximation and improving efficiency in preference-based alignment.
 * **Dense Reward Signals:** Intermediate rewards are generated for partial outputs by either humans, heuristics, or LLM critics, allowing for more stable and informative optimization of generation behaviors.
* **Verifier-Guided Training:** Employs secondary models‚Äîverifiers or critics‚Äîto offer continual feedback and correct output trajectories in real time.

**Where It‚Äôs Used:**
* Safety-critical LLMs demanding interpretable alignment
* Scenarios needing fast adaptation to changing objectives (e.g., customizable assistants)

## üëæ Day 4: Hierarchical and Multi-Turn RL for LLMs <a id='week6day4'></a>

**Brief Intro:**
Hierarchical RL (HRL) and multi-turn RL techniques allow agents to structure long-term, multi-step reasoning by learning high-level strategies (policies over tasks) and delegating lower-level actions (token or utterance generation). This mirrors human approaches to solving complex problems and offers significant advances for complex dialogue, tool use, and task automation.

**Key Concepts:**
* **Hierarchical RL:** Decomposes the RL process into multiple layers (e.g., task selection and action execution) for better credit assignment and temporal abstraction.
* **Multi-Turn RL:** Optimizes communication and decision-making over extended conversations or multi-part tasks, addressing long-term dependencies.
* **Actor-Critic Hierarchies:** Combines off-policy high-level learning (e.g., value functions over entire dialogues) with low-level on-policy token optimization.

**Where It‚Äôs Used:**
* Complex agentic LLMs (web agents, tool-using bots)
* Advanced QA, customer support, and autonomous decision-making agents

## üëæ Day 5: Multi-Agent and Cooperative RL for Language Models
<a id='week6day5'></a>
**Brief Intro:**
Multi-agent RL (MARL) extends beyond single-model optimization, focusing on collaboration, negotiation, and emergent strategies between multiple LLMs or agents. Cooperative MARL frameworks allow language agents to solve tasks requiring collective intelligence or simulate realistic social environments for AI development.

**Key Concepts:**
* **Multi-Agent RL:** Multiple LLMs/agents interact, compete, or collaborate within shared environments, coordinating policies to achieve group or individual goals.
* **Collaborative Co-Training:** Post-training paradigms where LLMs discuss, critique, and refine solutions together, leading to higher generalization across domains.
* **Communication Protocols:** Development of emergent language and negotiation skills among AI agents.

**Where It‚Äôs Used:**
* Task-based collaborative bots
* Research on emergent communication and cooperation in language
* Simulation environments for negotiation, multi-speaker dialogues, and distributed reasoning

## üëæ Day 6: Reasoning Expansion, Prolonged RL, and the Future of RL for NLP <a id='week6day6'></a>

**Brief Intro:**
Recent research shows that reinforcement learning, when scaled and properly designed, can push the reasoning boundaries of LLMs, discovering new cognitive strategies and improving their adaptability. The future points toward hybrid reward sources, verifier-guided optimization, multi-objective alignment, and efficient integration with multimodal tasks.

**Key Concepts:**
* **Prolonged RL (ProRL):** Long-duration RL training on challenging reasoning suites consistently expands LLMs' ability, uncovering novel solution paths not seen in pre-trained models.
* **Verifier/LLM Critic-Guided RL:** A verifier model delivers ongoing feedback (synthetic or human-in-the-loop) to guide model alignment more precisely than scalar rewards alone.
* **Multi-Objective and Hybrid RL:** Simultaneously balances multiple user needs, policies, or constraints (e.g., factuality, safety, specificity).
* **Trends:**
  - Scalable and sample-efficient RL for reasoning and tool use
  - Multimodal RL (text + audio + visual)
  - Explainable and industry-specialized RL fine-tuning

 # ü¶ù Week 8: Speech and Multimodal NLP

The next two weeks covers how NLP extends beyond text to handle **speech** and **multimodal inputs** (e.g., combining audio, text, and vision). This week focuses on **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** ‚Äî a field that lets machines **"speak"** like humans, using deep learning to turn written sentences into expressive audio. We‚Äôll learn the pipeline end-to-end and build a working mini-project.

---

<a id="week8day1"></a>
##  üëæ Day 1: Introduction to Speech & Multimodality

Modern NLP isn‚Äôt just about processing text ‚Äî it's increasingly about enabling human-like communication across **voice**, **vision**, and **language**. Speech plays a central role in digital assistants, accessibility, and human-computer interaction. This day introduces the importance of speech in AI applications like Siri, Google Assistant, and accessibility tools. We also explore the rise of multimodal systems that integrate multiple input types. Get a quick overview [here](https://www.appen.com/blog/an-introduction-to-audio-speech-and-language-processing).

We‚Äôll also reflect on [why multimodality matters](https://www.aigrandcentral.com/directory/what-is-multimodal-ai-a-beginner-friendly-guide-that-actually-makes-sense-article-99.aspx), especially in a world where humans naturally combine modes when they communicate (e.g., gestures + speech). Tools like [Whisper](https://openai.com/index/whisper/), CLIP, and Flamingo will be briefly mentioned to show how cutting-edge models are moving beyond unimodal processing.

By the end of today, you‚Äôll understand what it means to "go beyond text" and how speech interfaces are becoming central to next-gen NLP systems.

**Key Concepts:**
- What is speech processing in NLP?
- Why multimodality matters: combining text, audio, and images
- Use cases: virtual agents, screen readers, real-time translation, voice search

## üëæ Day 2 : TTS ‚Äì Text Analysis Module

###  Text-to-Speech (TTS): "Read Aloud" Technology

TTS converts written input into spoken output. The goal is to produce **natural**, **expressive**, and **intelligible** speech that mimics human speakers of various ages, genders, and emotions. This day focuses on **Text Analysis**.


#### Text Analysis (NLP Module)
   - **Text normalization :**
   Before converting text to speech, we must convert non-standard words like abbreviations, numbers, symbols, and acronyms into their spoken equivalents.
```
E.g., "Dr. Smith won 1st place" ‚Üí "Doctor Smith won first place"
```

   - **Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) conversion**
   Text is made up of graphemes (letters), but we speak in phonemes (sounds). This module converts sequences like ‚Äúph‚Äù into their correct phonetic output (‚Äúf‚Äù), often using phonetic dictionaries or neural models.
   
   - **Prosody prediction (intonation, rhythm, pitch)**
    Prosody refers to the intonation, stress, rhythm, and speech melody that conveys meaning beyond words‚Äîlike sarcasm, emphasis, or emotion.
Predicting the right prosodic features makes the speech sound natural rather than robotic.

The Text Analysis Module is essentially the "reading comprehension" step for TTS

üîó**To get a nice overview :** [TTS using NLP ‚Äì Medium](https://tulshidas-lingayat17.medium.com/text-to-speech-using-natural-language-processing-b19fabe9db73)
üîó**A more detailed pipeline** [here](https://tts-tutorial.github.io/interspeech2022/INTERSPEECH_Tutorial_TTS.pdf).

<a id="week8day3"></a>
## üëæ Day 3 : TTS ‚Äì Spectrogram Generation



Once the input text is analyzed and converted into linguistic features, the next step is to turn these into a **mel-spectrogram**‚Äîa visual representation of audio over time. This process is handled by the acoustic model, which bridges the gap between text and sound.

[Popular neural models](https://anwarvic.github.io/speech-synthesis/) like **[Tacotron](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10135)** (Tacotron uses an attention-based encoder-decoder with RNNs), **[FastSpeech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04558)** (FastSpeech and its successor FastSpeech 2 adopt Transformer-based non-[autoregressive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_model) architecture for fast, parallel spectrogram creation), and **VITS** (VITS integrates spectrogram generation and waveform synthesis using a variational/adversarial approach for more expressive, end-to-end speech) learn to predict these spectrograms from text sequences by modeling patterns of pitch, duration, and intensity. 

These spectrograms serve as intermediate representations that capture the acoustic characteristics of speech, ready to be transformed into waveforms by a vocoder in the next stage.



<a id="week8day4"></a>
## üëæ Day 4 : TTS ‚Äì Neural Vocoders
Now we learn how [vocoders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning_speech_synthesis) like WaveNet or HiFi-GAN generate audio waveforms from spectrograms.

Once the mel-spectrogram is generated from input text, we need to convert this visual-like representation of sound into an actual audible waveform ‚Äî that is, the raw audio you can hear. A waveform is simply a series of pressure values over time that simulate sound waves. Traditional vocoders used signal processing techniques to approximate these waves, but they often sounded robotic or unnatural.

Neural vocoders solve this by using deep learning to model the complex relationships between spectrogram features and natural audio waveforms. These models are trained on large datasets of paired spectrograms and real human speech, learning how to generate high-fidelity audio one sample at a time. 

For example, [WaveNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WaveNet) uses [autoregressive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_model) generation (predicting one sample at a time based on previous ones), while HiFi-GAN uses non-autoregressive methods to produce audio much faster, making it suitable for real-time applications. Different vocoder architectures (WaveNet, [WaveGlow](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00002), HiFi-GAN) trade off between speed, quality, and complexity.

- Neural vocoders: WaveNet, WaveGlow, HiFi-GAN
- Tradeoffs: Real-time vs quality

**See detail about HiFi-Gan** [**here**](https://ai-scholar.tech/en/articles/speech-synthesis%2Fhifi-gan)
[See](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03099) benchmarking framework comparing vocoder performance and trade‚Äëoffs (quality, latency, generalization) across multiple models in a unified setup.

<a id="week8day5"></a>
## üëæ Day 5 : Latest Trends in TTS (2024‚Äì25)

We now explore how modern TTS systems are evolving beyond just "reading text aloud." Recent research focuses on making speech more expressive, personalized, inclusive, and efficient ‚Äî especially for deployment on edge devices like smartphones or IoT hardware.

Cutting-edge systems now synthesize speech that reflects emotion, adapts to new speakers with minimal data, and handles multilingual or code-switched inputs ‚Äî all while keeping latency low enough for real-time interaction.

---
### Key Focuses:
- **Expressive and Emotional TTS**
  Models now capture subtle emotions like joy, sadness, urgency, or sarcasm ‚Äî crucial for human‚ÄìAI interaction in assistants, games, or therapy bots. [See more](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SLT2024__EmoCtrlTTS.pdf).
  ‚Üí *Example: Emotional Tacotron, GPT-SoVITS*

- **Personalized and Adaptive Voices**
  TTS can adapt to new speakers from just seconds of reference audio, enabling personal voice clones, celebrity voices, or synthetic dubs.
  ‚Üí *Popular methods: Few-shot speaker adaptation, zero-shot voice cloning*

- **Multilingual + Code-Switched TTS**
  Seamless voice synthesis across multiple languages and dialects, even when mixed mid-sentence (code-switching), is especially relevant for India, Southeast Asia, and Africa. [See more](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04904).
  ‚Üí *Models like NLLB-TTS, SeamlessM4T, and Festival-Multilingual*

- **Real-time Edge Deployment**
  Efficient neural vocoders (like HiFi-GAN and LPCNet) allow TTS on low-powered devices without a GPU, unlocking accessibility for mobile and embedded applications.

---

###  Low-Resource & Personalized TTS

Adaptation to low-resource settings is a growing research frontier. This includes building TTS systems for underrepresented languages, dialects, or speaker groups where data is sparse.

- **Zero-shot / Few-shot [Voice Cloning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00579):**
  Generate high-quality speech from a new speaker using just a few seconds of audio (or no audio at all, with metadata). See more on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02418).

- **TTS for Low-Resource Languages:**
  Techniques like multilingual pretraining, transfer learning, and synthetic data augmentation help build systems even for languages with few recordings. A good PDF [here](https://aclanthology.org/2022.aacl-main.56.pdf).

- **Speaker Adaptation:**
  Personalize TTS to user voice, accent, or speaking style with minimal training time and resources.

<a id="week9day1"></a>
## üëæ Day 1: Introduction to ASR

Today, we begin exploring [**Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)**](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/what-is-asr)‚Äîthe technology that converts spoken language into text. ASR powers everything from virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to automated subtitles on YouTube and real-time transcription services. Understanding the basic workflow of ASR helps set the stage for upcoming days.

ASR involves capturing speech, preprocessing the audio, extracting features, and finally decoding it into text using language and acoustic models. It's not just about recognition‚Äîchallenges like background noise, speaker variability, accents, and domain-specific vocabularies make ASR a rich and evolving research area.

Modern ASR has shifted from traditional modular systems (acoustic + language + pronunciation models) to **[End-to-End Deep Learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1566253524002008)** approaches that simplify the pipeline while improving performance.These [**End-to-End ASR**](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1187/5/052068/pdf) systems directly map audio to text using architectures like **[CTC](https://apxml.com/courses/applied-speech-recognition/chapter-3-acoustic-modeling-deep-learning/connectionist-temporal-classification-ctc) (Connectionist Temporal Classification)**, **Attention-based [Seq2Seq](https://apxml.com/courses/applied-speech-recognition/chapter-4-advanced-acoustic-models/seq2seq-models-for-asr)**, and **RNN-T**, leveraging powerful deep learning methods like CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers.

To further improve performance‚Äîespecially in **multilingual** or **low-resource** settings‚Äîmodern ASR systems use **self-supervised learning** (e.g., wav2vec 2.0) or **massive multitask pretraining** (e.g., Whisper). These models learn from raw audio at scale and can be fine-tuned for specific languages or domains.


See a nice course on ASR [here](https://apxml.com/courses/applied-speech-recognition).

## üëæ Day 2 & 3: Whisper and wav2vec ‚Äì Multilingual ASR

In these two days we explore modern ASR systems that work across multiple languages, noise levels, and accents.

###  Whisper by OpenAI

[Whisper](https://openai.com/research/whisper) is a multilingual, multitask ASR model trained on over 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervised data collected from the web. It uses an **encoder-decoder Transformer architecture** similar to those used in machine translation. Its design makes it highly effective for:

- Multilingual transcription 
- Zero-shot translation 
- Handling noisy, real-world audio 
- Code-switched or low-resource languages

Under the hood, Whisper converts raw audio into a **log-mel spectrogram**, which is fed to a Transformer encoder. The decoder then autoregressively generates the transcribed text.

You can experiment with different Whisper model sizes (`tiny`, `base`, `small`, `medium`, `large`) and observe trade-offs in speed and accuracy.

#### Hands-On Tasks:
- Try Whisper using open-source scripts on Colab
- Test with multilingual and accented audio
- Explore how Whisper handles multilingual or zero-shot input

###  ASR with wav2vec 2.0
**wav2vec 2.0** is a self-supervised model by Meta AI. Instead of relying on labeled data, it learns powerful **speech representations** directly from raw audio. It‚Äôs pre-trained using contrastive loss, where the model distinguishes real future audio segments from fake ones.

After pretraining, wav2vec 2.0 can be **fine-tuned** on a relatively small labeled dataset for transcription. This makes it especially valuable in **low-resource** or **code-switched** speech settings.

wav2vec 2.0 has a **convolutional encoder** that processes raw waveform and a **Transformer** for context modeling. The final output is optimized using **Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)** loss or, in some versions, **attention-based decoders**.

####  Hands-On Tasks
- Learn speech feature extraction using wav2vec 2.0 
- Fine-tune it on small datasets using HuggingFace Transformers 
- Try it on multilingual or code-switched data

### Intro to Deep Learning Approaches to ASR:

Modern ASR models have evolved beyond traditional HMM-GMM pipelines into fully neural architectures. Common components include:

- **CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification)**: Aligns input audio to text without pre-segmented labels 
- **Encoder-Decoder with Attention**: Transforms audio into text with explicit alignment via attention 
- **Transformers for ASR**: Models like Whisper and wav2vec2 use self-attention for context-rich understanding 
- **RNN-Transducer (RNN-T)**: Combines encoder, prediction, and joint networks for streaming ASR

### Comparing ASR Models
---
We now compare three leading deep learning-based ASR models‚Äîeach with different trade-offs in **latency, architecture, and accuracy**.

| Model         | Architecture           | Inference Style | Strengths                               | Weaknesses                  |
|---------------|------------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **DeepSpeech** | RNN + CTC              | Offline          | Simpler architecture, open-source        | Less accurate, not multilingual |
| **wav2vec 2.0** | Transformer + CTC      | Offline/Fast     | Self-supervised, high accuracy           | Needs language-specific tuning |
| **Whisper**     | Encoder-Decoder (RNN-T) | Offline          | Multilingual, robust to noise, translation support | Slower inference, heavy compute |

---

###  Decoding Strategies

#### -> Greedy decoding ‚Äì pick highest probability token at each step.

  At each time step, the model selects the token with the highest probability. It's the simplest and fastest method, but it doesn‚Äôt consider the overall sequence, which can lead to suboptimal results.
#### -> Beam search ‚Äì consider multiple token paths to improve accuracy.
  Instead of picking just the top token, beam search keeps track of the top k most likely sequences (beam width). This allows the model to explore better combinations of words, significantly improving transcription quality‚Äîespecially in longer or ambiguous utterances.
#### -> Language model integration ‚Äì boost decoding by guiding it with prior linguistic knowledge.
External language models (like n-gram or Transformers) can be combined with ASR outputs to refine decoding. The LM helps ensure the generated text is syntactically and semantically plausible, especially in noisy or low-resource scenarios.


---

### Use case and the Model:
| Use Case             | Preferred Model   | Reason                    |
|----------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Real-time captioning | wav2vec (small)   | Faster decoding           |
| Batch transcription  | Whisper / wav2vec | High accuracy             |
| Noisy environments   | Whisper           | Trained on noisy data     |

## üëæ Day 5 : Cross-Modal NLP Trends (2024‚Äì25)

Now we will explore the evolution of [multimodal systems](https://introtodeeplearning.com/2017/lectures/Multimodal%20learning.pdf) that unify speech, text, and images to enable more natural and intelligent AI applications.

[Modern AI](https://www.aigrandcentral.com/directory/what-is-multimodal-ai-a-beginner-friendly-guide-that-actually-makes-sense-article-99.aspx) models are increasingly multimodal ‚Äî meaning they can understand and generate across multiple input types. For example, systems can now answer questions about an image using spoken queries or perform visual search via voice commands. This is possible thanks to advancements in **cross-modal architectures** and **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, where information is retrieved from external sources and fused with model outputs.



### Cross-modal RAG and Voice Interfaces

- **Cross-modal RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** 
  Traditional RAG systems retrieve relevant text snippets from a knowledge base to help generate better textual responses. In **cross-modal RAG**, the retrieval and generation steps span across different modalities. For example, a model may retrieve textual data in response to an audio query, or retrieve relevant images or audio clips based on a text prompt. 
  This enables more natural and flexible interactions ‚Äî such as asking a question via speech and receiving a multimodal answer that includes both a spoken response and a visual reference.
  
   A github repo on multimodal RAG [here](https://github.com/JarvisUSTC/Awesome-Multimodal-RAG).
   An Easy Introduction to Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Video and Audio by [Nvidia](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/an-easy-introduction-to-multimodal-retrieval-augmented-generation-for-video-and-audio/).

- **Audio-to-text QA** 
  This involves asking questions through spoken language and receiving textual answers. It combines **automatic speech recognition (ASR)** with **question answering (QA)** systems. The ASR first transcribes the speech input, then the QA model identifies and returns the appropriate answer. This is useful in hands-free environments or accessibility-focused tools.
  
   [WavRAG: Audio-Integrated Retrieval Augmented Generation for Spoken Dialogue Models](arxiv.org/abs/2502.14727)

- **Voice-command visual search** 
  This is the situation where users issue voice commands to search through visual datasets (images, videos, documents). For example, a system might support queries like ‚Äúshow me photos with red cars taken at night‚Äù or ‚Äúfind the slide where Einstein is mentioned.‚Äù 
  This requires integrating **speech recognition**, **semantic understanding**, and **image retrieval** in a unified pipeline. Modern systems use models like CLIP or GPT-4o to map both voice inputs and images into a common representation space, enabling effective cross-modal search.
