‘Ethical Hacking’ was a ‘project’ under the PClub with an aim to familiarise the campus junta with the field and to prepare for CTFs. 
After an initial reading on HTML, Javascript and PHP, we moved on to beginner challeges - [Bandits](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) and [Natas](http://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/). These were helpful for learning basic bash commands and web security. The challenges on Hack This Site!, primarily the [javascript challenges](https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/javascript/) were also attempted.

 We also completed the first two weeks of the Cyber Security course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/software-security/home). 

Apart from this, we also read basic assembly language and binary exploitation. First few challeges on [MicroCorruption](https://microcorruption.com/) were completed.

We also participated in an intra-campus CTF and attempted a few archived challenges of [Backdoor](https://backdoor.sdslabs.co/), SDS Labs.
