# Competitive Programming Roadmap

## Introduction
Competitive programming is a sport where participants solve complex coding problems within a certain time frame. This roadmap will guide you through the essential topics and skills required.

## Beginner
- Learn a programming language (C++, Python, Java)
- Basic Data Structures (Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists)
- Basic Algorithms (Sorting, Searching)

## Intermediate
- Advanced Data Structures (Stacks, Queues, Hash Maps)
- Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Shortest Path)
- Dynamic Programming

## Advanced
- Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees
- Advanced Graph Algorithms (Network Flow, Bipartite Matching)
- Geometry and Number Theory

## Resources
- Online Judges (Codeforces, LeetCode, HackerRank)
- Books (Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, The Art of Computer Programming by Knuth)
